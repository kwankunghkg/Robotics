Tutorial and demonstration on how to make an Arduino-powered star-finder device for a telescope - which can allow you to point the telescope at any number of astronomical objects in the night sky. Please see the Instructables project guide (link below). This project won the Grand Prize in the Instructables Space Contest it was entered into.   
Space is big. Really big. Owning a small telescope can give a lot of pleasure, but it's often a struggle trying to locate specific objects in the night sky. In this project I made and integrated an Arduino-powered star-finder with a small reflecting telescope, to allow me to easily find the galaxies, nebulae and clusters that I wanted to observe.  
What: This device calculates the current position in the night sky of a list of galaxies, nebulae and star clusters. It then measures the current heading and elevation of the telescope, and displays to the user how to orientate their telescope so that the chosen target object will be visible. The electronics are all contained within a convenient handset, attached to the telescope mount on a 0.5m cable.  
Why: Traditional methods of finding objects in the night sky (using charts, maps, following constellations) are slow and require experience, and motorised 'Go-To' telescopes are very expensive. This project finds a happy medium between the two. Clear night skies are not common, so using this Arduino star-finder allows you to make the most of your precious viewing time.

In this video, Derek takes a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, inertial measurement unit, CCD camera, and a beefed-up pan & tilt mechanism to create an automated planet tracker. Everything is orchestrated via a custom arcade-style controller centered around a Raspberry Pi running C++/OpenCV code to run the UI and control positioning: http://bit.ly/2vGQ6xb

This is a equatorial mount, so its not alt-az angles but Ra-Dec. Those calculations are quite easy. For the Ra axis, it should perform a full rotation in 23h56m04s, as this is the sidereal day (the time earth takes for a full rotation). With that and the diameter of the Ra-ring, the size of the pulley and the step angle of the motor the tracking rate can be calculated. For Dec its even easier, as the movement of the axis corresponds to the coordinate system. For example, a change of 45° in DEC is also a 45° movement of the axis, so the calculation is very easy

The Original design idea came from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su6O6.... The designer published the 3D CAD files but they were not compatible with my CAD software so I recreated the mechanical design with FreeCAD and adapted it to my TEAC stepper motors. The motors are driven by a pair of A4988 stepper motor drivers that are controlled by an NEC V25 SBC I had from an older project. The controller board runs a drive+controller application that can be accessed through a serial link and managed through either a serial console (e.g. minicom) or commands issues by a remote program (I use a set of Python scripts for different applications). This setup allows the controller to maintain a simple set of command primitives that are use by higher level code to implement more complex applications such as integration with OpenCV for object tracking.
