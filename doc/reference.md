Cruise Automation San Francisco Bay Area
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_(autonomous_vehicle)
	In September 2021, Cruise received a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to provide driverless taxi rides in the state. The permit allows the company to provide the service without the inclusion of safety drivers - staff that would accompany the vehicle and take control of it if necessary.
