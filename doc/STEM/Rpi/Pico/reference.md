The new Pi Pico has two cores. How can we use both? And: If you want to play with the Pico, this video can save you a lot of time because we will discover the main differences between programming an Arduino and a Pi Pico. After this video, you will know more than 99% of all Pi Pico users. And you know how to avoid some quirks.

Raspberry Pi RP2040 gains an extra USB port through PIO's (programmable I/Os) - CNX Software   
  http://www.tuxmachines.org/printpdf/161511  
  
Raspberry Pi RP2040 gains an extra USB port through PIO‚Äôs (programmable I/Os)  
  https://www.cnx-software.com/2022/02/16/raspberry-pi-rp2040-gains-an-extra-usb-port-through-pio/  
	The Raspberry Pi RP2040 specifications only list one USB 1.1 Host/Device hardware interface, but developer‚Äôs Sekigon Gonnoc decided to leverage the microcontroller‚Äôs programmable I/Os (PIO) to add an extra USB port that also works in host or device mode.  
	While the C library is still supposed to be a work in progress Sekigon implemented full-speed (12 Mbps) and slow-speed (1.5Mbps) host, full-speed device, USB hub, and multi-port support. There‚Äôs even a demo with three ‚ÄúPico Pico USB‚Äù keyboards acting as USB hubs and HID plus a wireless mouse to show the results.  
	The implementation uses one PIO for the USB transmitter using 22 instructions and one state machine and another PIO for the USB receiver using 31 instructions and two state machines, as well as one 1ms loop timer for the host, and one PIO interrupt for the receiver.  
	You‚Äôll find the code to implement the extra USB port on RP2040 MCU through PIO on the Pico-PIO-USB Github repository including two samples:  
	1.	capture_hid_report.c USB host sample program that prints HID reports received from a device.  
	2.	usb_device.c HID USB FS device sample which moves mouse cursor every 0.5s.  
	Another more advanced sample is the QMK firmware for the Pico Pico USB board. The hardware keyboard also appears to be designed by Sekigon Gonnoc, but I could not find any information about it. Having said that, he previously designed the Pico Micro RP2040 board and sold it through Booth.pm, a ‚Äúcreator market‚Äù for the Japanese market that looks somewhat similar to Tindie to me, except it also works for artists.

Pi Pico - Arduino IDE, Pin mapping for GPIO in IDE   
  https://forum.arduino.cc/t/pi-pico-arduino-ide-pin-mapping-for-gpio-in-ide/903691  
Pins GP0 through GP29 are mapped to Arduino "pins" 0 through 29.  
It looks like you can also use "p0" through "p29"...  
	Arduino Analog pins 0 through 3 are mapped to pins GP26 through GP29.

Raspberry Pico SPI and I2C pins #194   
  https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed/issues/194  
Connect the OLED display SDA to Pico pin 9 (GP6) and SCL to Pico pin 10 (GP7). This was based on the discussion here - the Arduino-mbed-Pico board uses a fixed i2c-1 assignment for SDA and SCL.  
	The official hardware documentation says following.  
	I2C  
		GP4 SDA  
		GP5 SCL  
	SPI0  
		GP16 SS  
		GP17 MISO  
		GP18 SCK  
		GP19 MOSI  
I think the board definition should follow the official docs as a reference.  
SDA on GP6 and SCL on GP7 is I2C 1 not 0 as expected  
MISO is GP4, MOSI GP3, SCK is GP2, SS is GP5  
this should changed to the pins above.  
There is a need a function to set alternative pins for UART, SPI, I2C  
On Mbed you do it when declaring a class like MbedI2C I2C(GP6, GP7);  
The DX core https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore have this functionality

In previous videos I have talked about how CPUs work and machine code. I have also talked about how to design your own CPU instruction set, and how to write an assembler for that instruction set. Now it is time to emulate your CPU and run the code output by the assembler.

The Apple IIe uses a custom microcontroller and ROM chip to put ASCII values into the computer‚Äôs memory. How hard could it be to replace that dual-chip setup with a microcontroller to emulate another kind of keyboard? Bald Engineer tries using an Arduino Mega 2560, Teensy 4.0, and a Pi Pico to replace a vintage ROM chip. See what works AND what does not! https://bit.ly/39vfTIS

***** Raspberry Pi Pico PIO - 8 Little Processors You Can Program		Gary Explains May 3, 2022

The processor in the Raspberry Pi Pico, the RP2040, has a feature called PIO -  Programmable Input/Output. As a result you have access to 8 little processors with their own assembly language which you can program to create deterministic interfaces to the real world.  
The Pico's PIOs are programmable like general processors. The 8 state machines processors can independently execute programs to manipulate GPIOs and transfer data.

While developing the software and hardware for Raspberry Pi Pico, our engineers wanted to make sure everything works perfectly, right up to the theoretical limit. Here, Graham Sanderson experiments with Bitshifter to run BBC Micro emulation on Pico. We don't have any code available for you at this time, but promise we're bugging Graham daily to write something up. For more examples of how Graham experiments with Raspberry Pi Pico, check out his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2LJxnuCy-BrSUNJuNp5QA

Adding an LCD screen to your Raspberry Pi Pico projects is always a great feature to have in your tool kit. Whether it's for a user interface display or for a game console it adds that visual feedback that some devices need.  
Cheap, SPI based LCD TFT units, with driver chips such as the ILI9341 are easing found on eBay and Amazon and can be simply connected to your Pi Pico with only six GP pins.   
In this video I'll show you how to connect the display, download a driver to code it and then run some demos to test that it all works.

In computer engineering and electrical engineering, bit banging is slang for any method of data transmission that employs software as a substitute for dedicated hardware to generate transmitted signals or process received signals. Software directly sets and samples the states of GPIOs (e.g., pins on a microcontroller), and is responsible for meeting all timing requirements and protocol sequencing of the signals.

420Mhz!!!  Warning, your mileage may vary. Overclocking could shorten the life of your Pico, although mine seems fine :-)   
In this video I show how to set the Pico CPU clock from under-clocking to save power all the way to maximum overclock which for me topped out at 420Mhz!!!  Beware however there is a catch... with the maximum overclock your flash memory will stop talking to your pico CPU. This is recoverable so don't worry just load another program with a different clock speed.

CircuitPython vs MicroPython interrupt  
  
CircuitPython vs MicroPython: Key Differences  
  https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/circuitpython-vs-micropython-differences/  
  
  
Asynchronous events: what are your use cases? #4542   
  https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/4542  
	People ask if CircuitPython supports interrupts. It does not support user-written interrupt handlers in the way that MicroPython or Arduino do. However, it of course does use interrupts internally for specific functionality, such as PulseIn, countio, rotaryio, etc., etc.  
	MicroPython supports Pin interrupt handlers and Timer-based interrupt handlers. The MicroPython documentation describes a number of restrictions, caveats and warnings about interrupt handler routines. These kinds of issues, and the issues of using concurrency and shared objects safely, are some reasons we have felt interrupt support as found in MicroPython and Arduino is not a great match for our target audience.  
	What are your own specific cases for interrupts (that is, asynchronous event support)?  
		What do you need to trigger on? E.g.:  
		a. A pin level change or edge.  
		b. Some microcontroller internal event (which ones?).  
		c. A timer-based interval.  
		What kind of latency is OK? (E.g., "soft" vs "hard" interrupts)  
		What do you need to do when the event happens? E.g. (not inclusive):  
		a. Set a flag, to be checked later  
		b. Do something immediately (e.g., change another pin's value).  
		c. Ask for something to be done in the near future (e.g. read a sensor, write out some data).  
	We would not expect to satisfy all the requirements people have, but studying the kinds of things people want to do will be helpful towards coming up with mechanisms. Thanks. (For instance, #4540 describes of a use case that I thought of while thinking about posting this issue.)
