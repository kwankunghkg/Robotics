This socket programming tutorial will show you how to connect multiple clients to a server using python 3 sockets. It covers how to send messages from clients to server and from server to clients. I will also show you how to host your socket server locally or globally across the internet so anyone can connect. This uses the python 3 socket and threading module.

python script first line Shebang
	Shebang Line - The first line of all your Python programs should be a shebang line, which tells your computer that you want Python to execute this program. The shebang line begins with #!, but the rest depends on your operating system.
  On Windows, the shebang line is #! python3
  On OS X,    the shebang line is #! /usr/bin/env python3
  On Linux,   the shebang line is #! /usr/bin/python3

App Inventor 2 來了
http://www.appinventor.tw/ai2
MIT 行動學習中心已發表 App Inventor 2 (本文後簡稱 AI2)，省略了需要使用 Java 才能開啟的 Blocks Editor，將其整合在網頁中即可使用，可說是與 Scratch 愈來愈像了。在操作上也將各指令藉由下拉式選單大幅簡化，使用者應該可以更快找到所需的指令。
