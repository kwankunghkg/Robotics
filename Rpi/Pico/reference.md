Version 0.1 Raspberry Pi Engine Control with Real-Time, Adaptive Machine Learning (Linux, HCCI)		Adam Vaughan Jan 9, 2015

This is my first attempt at engine control with an adaptive Extreme Learning Machine algorithm I designed to predict non-stationary, near chaotic Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion time series in real-time.  A high-level overview about the approach is available at:  
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yrLW...  
Pressure data acquisition is recording 240,000 18-bit samples per second (total, all channels) with assembly code added to the Linux kernel in an FIQ.  Control commands must be calculated with less than ~300 microseconds of latency to maintain control.  I have the control algorithm running in PREEMPT_RT Linux user space and streaming processed data to a d3.js web-based UI over a WebSocket.  
The model training data is from a previous engine in 2012, and took 40 minutes of test cell time to acquire.  I haven't re-trained the model for this new engine yet, and only one cylinder's worth of data is used for training (all cylinder models are the same before adaptation).  
A pre-print paper about the algorithm is available at:  
  http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3567  
The final paper is available here:

PicoSystem is a pocket-sized handheld gaming console, Powered by the Raspberry Pi's RP2040 chip the same CPU used In the Raspberry Pi Pico!  
This thing is pretty cool and it's a  hackable dev handheld gaming console that you can easily make your own games for. Hopefully, in the near future, we can see some emulators like NES PC engine and Gameboy running on the Pico System, and of course I’m waiting for a DOOM port!  
  
  
What is VGA and How to Use it With a Raspberry Pi Pico / Gary Explains / 2022Jul12

VGA is de-facto PC video standard. It is an analogue video system with a heritage from the IBM PS/2. The Raspberry Pi Pico is fast enough to generate a VGA signal in real time! In this video I look at VGA, how it works, and how to build a simple DAC for generating a VGA signal using the Pico.
