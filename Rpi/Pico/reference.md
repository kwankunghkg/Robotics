Machine learning, combustion engines and real-time control / Liz Upton / 13th Jan 2015

Version 0.1 Raspberry Pi Engine Control with Real-Time, Adaptive Machine Learning (Linux, HCCI) Adam Vaughan Jan 9, 2015  
https://youtu.be/qQG7ocnE3EA  
45,274 views 374 276 subscribers  
This is my first attempt at engine control with an adaptive Extreme Learning Machine algorithm I designed to predict non-stationary, near chaotic Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion time series in real-time. A high-level overview about the approach is available at:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yrLW...  
Pressure data acquisition is recording 240,000 18-bit samples per second (total, all channels) with assembly code added to the Linux kernel in an FIQ. Control commands must be calculated with less than ~300 microseconds of latency to maintain control. I have the control algorithm running in PREEMPT_RT Linux user space and streaming processed data to a d3.js web-based UI over a WebSocket.  
The model training data is from a previous engine in 2012, and took 40 minutes of test cell time to acquire. I haven't re-trained the model for this new engine yet, and only one cylinder's worth of data is used for training (all cylinder models are the same before adaptation).  
A pre-print paper about the algorithm is available at:  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3567  
The final paper is available here:

PicoSystem is a pocket-sized handheld gaming console, Powered by the Raspberry Pi's RP2040 chip the same CPU used In the Raspberry Pi Pico!  
This thing is pretty cool and it's a hackable dev handheld gaming console that you can easily make your own games for. Hopefully, in the near future, we can see some emulators like NES PC engine and Gameboy running on the Pico System, and of course I’m waiting for a DOOM port!

What is VGA and How to Use it With a Raspberry Pi Pico / Gary Explains / 2022Jul12  
https://youtu.be/KSYjGul84aU  
22,099 views 1K 275K subscribers  
VGA is de-facto PC video standard. It is an analogue video system with a heritage from the IBM PS/2. The Raspberry Pi Pico is fast enough to generate a VGA signal in real time! In this video I look at VGA, how it works, and how to build a simple DAC for generating a VGA signal using the Pico.

Set up a Raspberry Pi Pico W or Pico to use CircuitPython / John Gallaugher /  Jan 30, 2023  Circuit Python Tutorials  
https://youtu.be/ND5UhTQlfWw  
6.06K subscribers / 4,815 views  //   
	Start here to learn CircuitPython on a Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W. We'll add CircuitPython to the Pico board, copy over the lib (library) files that we need to complete a series of assignments using a variety of sensors, motors, neopixels, and input devices. And we'll download the free Mu IDE so we can create, edit, and save CircuitPython programs.  
	This playlist is used in Prof. Gallaugher's Physical Computing course. All teachers, students, and other independent learners are welcome to use this content. If you find it helpful, PLEASE let me know! You are also most welcome to share with others and use this material in your own courses.

Connect your Raspberry Pi Pico W to Your WiFi Network Using CircuitPython / John Gallaugher /  Mar 8, 2023 / Circuit Python Tutorials  
https://youtu.be/l5A7Q4Z06Tc  
6.06K subscribers / 3,891 views  //  
	We'll learn to set up a Pico's settings.toml file, then write CircuitPython code so our Pico can log into our local network using the network password. We'll also access the worldtimeapi.org's time API to return information on time in a given time zone. We'll also see how JSON shows up in a browser without JSON-formatting extensions, and show how you can find browser formatting extensions for Chrome and Safari. This lesson sets us up for future lessons where we'll assemble time from the returned data and set the Pico's real time clock. We'll also use what we've learned here to get weather data in a future lesson.

	Learn how to create your own WiFi network using the Raspberry Pi Pico W in AP Mode. Connect and send information to up to five devices with WiFi without the Internet! This can be used to host web servers that devices can access as long as the network is running, and can later be used to send information between Pico W's without access to the global Internet!
