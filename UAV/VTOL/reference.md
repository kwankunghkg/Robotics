Combining an Arduino with a flight controller to accomplish the VTOL transitional mixes worked well! Obviously it would be ideal to integrate the Arduino code into the flight controller, but that's beyond my current coding skill level. Also, the majority of flight controllers nowadays only have 2x motor outputs and 4x servo outputs, which would work for this aircraft, but would struggle with a more complex setup. E.g a quadcopter VTOL would need 4 motor outputs, leaving only 2 outputs for servos.

How do you fly in 1% of Earth's atmosphere:  
Have large rotors (they are 1.2m in diameter) and spin them very fast, around 2500 RPM (5x the speed of a helicopter on Earth).
