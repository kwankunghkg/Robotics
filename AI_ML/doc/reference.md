In this GroqDay demo, we show how easy it is to get transformers, which were originally designed to perform natural language processing tasks, working on GroqChip™, enabled by Groq Compiler, to perform vision tasks such as image classification or object detection. We delivered up to 7x faster results compared to Nvidia’s A100.    
Register and watch the full GroqDay event at bit.ly/groqday2.
