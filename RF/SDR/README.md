	An introductory overview of Software Defined Radio (SDR) is given by Schuyler St. Leger at Desert Code Camp at Chandler-Gilbert Community College. The hour-long talk covers what SDR is and how it differs from hardware radio, SDR hardware available today, software tools to use with SDR HW, and live demonstrations of how to use SDR.

	Frank Lind / MIT Haystack Observatory  
	Dr. Frank D. Lind is a Research Engineer at MIT Haystack Observatory where he works to develop and use radio science instrumentation. At the Observatory he leads many technical efforts involving software radio instrumentation cutting across Geospace, Astronomy, and Space science. These instruments are used to make detailed physical measurements and have been part of many NSF, NASA, and DoD supported investigations. Key instrumentation includes the National Science Foundation’s Millstone Hill Geospace Radar Facility, the RAPID (Radio Array of Portable Interferometric Detectors) system, low cost array radars, software defined radio architectures for radio telescopes, and efforts to develop a space borne electromagnetic vector sensor for the upcoming NASA AERO (Aurora Emissions Radio Observer) and VISTA (Vector Interferometry Space Technology using AERO) cubesat missions. Dr. Lind studied at the University of Washington where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in 1994. He then joined the UW Geophysics Program and pursued studies leading to the Doctor of Philosophy in Geophysics in 1999. His work there focused on Passive Radar observations of the Aurora Borealis. He is a prior chair of USNC URSI Commission G (United States National Committee of the International Union of Radio Science), a member of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and a member of the IEEE.

KrakenSDR Radio Direction Finding Retune with Autocalibration Test 1 / The Kraken / Mar 19, 2021

	KrakenSDR is a 5-tuner coherent software defined radio based on RTL-SDR. It is the successor to the KerberosSDR and will be crowdfunded in 2021.  
	In this test KrakenSDR is used as a radio direction finder to determine the bearing towards various commercial transmitter towers located around the antenna.  
	The test shows how the KrakenSDR automatically recalibrates on frequency change. Unlike the KerberosSDR it is no longer necessary to manually disconnect the antennas and then recalibrate during each frequency retune.  
	The DSP software running on the Raspberry Pi is entirely open source and available at 
	  https://github.com/krakenrf  
	The Android App is closed source but free to use for non-commercial use.  
	The Arrow Antennas 5-element antenna array will be available for purchase during our crowdfunding campaign at a discount.

	KrakenSDR is a 5-tuner coherent software defined radio based on RTL-SDR. It is the successor to the KerberosSDR and will be crowdfunded in 2021.  
	In this test KrakenSDR is used on a vehicle as a Radio Direction Finder (RDF) with a 5-element circular antenna array made up of mag-whip antennas on the roof of the vehicle. The Android app logs the RDF bearings generated by the KrakenSDR and calculates cross points, eventually determining an estimated location of the transmitter once enough data is available. The GPS navigation feature helps the driver safely navigate to the estimate location without having to look at the screen too often.  
	The demo also shows how the KrakenSDR automatically recalibrates on frequency change. Unlike the KerberosSDR it is no longer necessary to manually disconnect the antennas and then recalibrate during each frequency retune.

	This video shows us putting the newly released KrakenSDR to the test.  We wanted to find the location of a DMR trunked network in order to determine the user.The Kraken amazed us by how quickly it was able to locate the transmitter site in this first test.  We were so impressed, we decided to go out and search for a P25 transmitter site in Test 2.

	Edit: Just to be abolutely clear, if you are scanning with SDRSharp, you can set the bandwidth to anything from 12500 Hz to down to 5000 Hz as demonstrated in the video, or even lower for certain types of transmissions. This also changes as you move up and down the band, as all ham bands are subdivided for various types of transmissions. For most people, a bandwidth of 12500 Hz will probably be more effective for standard analog unencrypted mesage traffic. But as always, try it out and experiment for yourself. Remember, this is just a very short introduction to the topic.
