	KrakenSDR is a 5-tuner coherent software defined radio based on RTL-SDR. It is the successor to the KerberosSDR and will be crowdfunded in 2021.  
	In this test KrakenSDR is used as a radio direction finder to determine the bearing towards various commercial transmitter towers located around the antenna.  
	The test shows how the KrakenSDR automatically recalibrates on frequency change. Unlike the KerberosSDR it is no longer necessary to manually disconnect the antennas and then recalibrate during each frequency retune.  
	The DSP software running on the Raspberry Pi is entirely open source and available at 
	  https://github.com/krakenrf  
	The Android App is closed source but free to use for non-commercial use.  
	The Arrow Antennas 5-element antenna array will be available for purchase during our crowdfunding campaign at a discount.
