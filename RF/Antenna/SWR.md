why antenna length is lambda / 4  
  https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-height-of-an-antenna-always-taken-to-be-lambda-divided-by-4  
	It is 1/4 wave because the field is strongest at 1/4 of the wave in a sinusoidal signal. The peaks occur at 1/4 and 3/4, in opposite polarity. So the 1/4 is the optimal length for peak signal.  
  
A too simple answer  
	there is a sin wave travelling in antenna and then antenna to air. Now at the end of antenna there must be an antinode for maximum power transmission.  
	By sin wave diagram you can see that peaks occur at lambda/4 and 3lambda/4.

Is a 1.2 SWR good?  
	Significance of the SWR reading  
	A value of 1.2 and 1.3 is considered to be excellent. An SWR of 1.5 indicates that virtually all the power is being absorbed by the antenna. The power being reflected back is only a very small amount is not anything to worry about.  
  
  
----  
  
Is a 2.5 SWR good?  
	SWR 2.5 - 2.9: Performance in this range will be noticeably decreased, and you might even damage your radio if you transmit frequently and for extended periods. We advise you not to operate your radio in this range.  
  
  
  
----  
  
What is a perfect SWR?  
	The ideal SWR range is 1.0-1.5. If you're operating at 1.5, you know that your system is in good shape, and you'll have excellent signal quality. If you want to drop to 1.0, you may need additional tuning with your antenna. However, you may not notice an expectational difference in quality.

What if SWR is higher on 1 than 40?  
	Adjust your antenna: If your SWR reading is higher on channel 40 than on channel 1, lower your antenna. For dual antennas, the process is the same. Adjust both antennas the same amount. If channel 1 is higher than 40, raise your antenna.

The basic CB type SWR meters will have a switch with FWD and REF. For these SWR meters put the switch to the FWD position, then key the transceiver turning the rotary controller until the needle is in the set position, then put the switch to the REF position for the SWR reading.

How to Use an SWR Meter: standing wave ratio meter - guidelines & tips / ElectronicsNotes /  Aug 17, 2018

	Standing wave ratio can be very important when using a  transmitter. If the level of standing waves is too high then it can either damage the transmitter or transceiver output, or cause it to reduce its power. So measuring the SWR is important. Knowing how to use an SWR meter and connect it up can be vital and it is described in this video along with some key hints and tips on how to use the SWR meter and gat the best from it.  
	SWR bridges or SWR meters come in many forms. They donâ€™t have to cost too much, although higher price ones do give better performance and they can measure more parameters like power levels.   
	The video describes how to connect the SWR meter into the feeder and then how to use it making sure that no undue interference is caused.    
	The video also describes the various points where SWR meters can be sued and their advantages and disadvantages. It also describes how to use the SWR meter when an ATU is present.  
	Another interesting points is the feeder loss and know how this affects the SWR readings. High feeder loss can make an antenna with a high SWR look much better, so it gives guidance on this. The video also gives a few useful bonus tips on how to use the SWR meter as well.
